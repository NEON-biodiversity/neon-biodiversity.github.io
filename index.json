A) Expected relationships among drivers, ITV, and biodiversity. B) Drivers and their expected dominant spatial scales of influence within NEON.   Scope Understanding how natural and human-made factors affect geographic patterns of biodiversity is essential for planning conservation efforts, especially in the face of rapid global changes. Geographic patterns of biodiversity are expected to be influenced by a combination of local biological factors, like competition among species, and by regional to continental physical factors, such as climate. However, this expectation has not been evaluated from local to continental scales across diverse species lineages. In addition, natural and human-made disturbances are likely to alter this expectation. We are a group of researchers at Michigan State University, Bryn Mawr College, University of Florida, Western Washington University, Washington Department of Natural Resources, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) working to test this idea from local to continental scales.\nWe use the geographic design of NEON across the USA and combine insights from satellite remote sensing and measurements from individual organisms to address three main research questions:\n  How does spatial scale influence intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in organism body size and its relationship with biodiversity across taxa within NEON?\n  How is disturbance regime explained by different scales of climate, geodiversity and land cover, and past land use across NEON?\n  How do relationships among climate, geodiversity and land cover, past land use, disturbance regime, and body size ITV explain variation in biodiversity across taxa from local to continental scales?\n  To address these questions, we are quantifying multiple biological and physical factors affecting biodiversity patterns of small mammals, fish, and ground beetles at nested spatial scales.\nWhat are the outcomes of this research?

However, little is known about how these factors affect predictions from species distribution models (SDMs) with respect to spatial grain and extent of the models. Objectives Understanding how spatial scale influences the effects of biological processes in SDMs is important because SDMs are one of the primary tools used by conservation biologists to assess biodiversity impacts of climate change. Data sources and study eligibility criteria We systematically reviewed SDM studies published from 2003–2015 using ISI Web of Science searches to: (1) determine the current state and key knowledge gaps of SDMs that incorporate biotic interactions and dispersal; and (2) understand how choice of spatial scale may alter the influence of biological processes on SDM predictions. Synthesis methods and limitations We used linear mixed effects models to examine how predictions from SDMs changed in response to the effects of spatial scale, dispersal, and biotic interactions. Results There were important biases in studies including an emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems in northern latitudes and little representation of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest that neither spatial extent nor grain influence projected climate-induced changes in species ranges when SDMs include dispersal or biotic interactions. Conclusions We identified several knowledge gaps and suggest that SDM studies forecasting the effects of climate change should: 1) address broader ranges of taxa and locations; and 1) report the grain size, extent, and results with and without biological complexity. The spatial scale of analysis in SDMs did not affect estimates of projected range shifts with dispersal and biotic interactions. However, the lack of reporting on results with and without biological complexity precluded many studies from our analysis.","tags":["Europe","Animal migration","Climate modeling","Climate change","Conservation biology","Research reporting guidelines","Species interactions","Systematic reviews"],"title":"Does scale matter?

Niche theory suggests temperature may affect richness by filtering traits and species in colder habitats while promoting specialization in warmer ones. However, tests of this theory are rare because niche dimensions are challenging to quantify along broad thermal gradients. Here, we use individual-level trait data from a long-term monitoring network spanning a large geographic extent to test niche-based theory of community assembly in small mammals. We examined variation in body size among 23 communities of North American rodents sampled across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), ranging from northern hardwood forests to subtropical deserts. We quantified body size similarity among species using a metric of overlap that accounts for individual variation, and fit a structural equation model to disentangle the relationships between temperature, productivity, body size overlap, and species richness. We document a latitudinal gradient of declining similarity in body size among species towards the tropics and overall increase in the dimensions of community-wide trait space in warmer habitats. Neither environmental temperature nor net primary productivity directly affect rodent species richness. Instead, temperature determines the community-wide niche space that species can occupy, which in turn alters richness.

Dan Janzen arrived at this prediction based on climatic constraints, while Robert MacArthur argued that a latitudinal gradient in resource specialization drives the pattern. This idea has some support when it comes to thermal niches, but has rarely been explored for other niche dimensions. Body size is linked to niche dimensions related to diet, competition and environmental tolerance in vertebrates. We identified 68 pairs of tropical and nontropical sister bird species using a comprehensive phylogeny and used the VertNet specimen database to ask whether tropical birds have lower intraspecific body-size variation than their nontropical sister species. Our results show that tropical species have less intraspecific variability in body mass (textlessimg class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/sites/default/files/highwire/roybiolett/14/1/20170453/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/textgreater; p = 0.009). Variation in body-size variability was poorly explained by both abiotic and biotic drivers; thus the mechanisms underlying the pattern are still unclear. The lower variation in body size of tropical bird species may have evolved in response to more stable climates and resource environments.","tags":null,"title":"Tropical bird species have less variable body sizes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phoebe L.

We identify five aspects of landscape structure that contribute to the co-occurrence of species and restrict or enable different types of biotic interactions: patch size and habitat amount, isolation of patches, barriers to dispersal and movement, persistence of landscape structure, and landscape complexity. In addition, these aspects of landscape structure influence the strength and outcome of biotic interactions. Whereas most research focuses on the effects of the abiotic environment on species and their biotic interactions, research on foundation species and ecosystem engineers demonstrates the important influence of biotic interactions on landscape structure itself, including effects on landscape complexity, extent of habitat, and the structure of landscape features. In this review, we describe ecological theories that lay the foundation for interplay between landscape structure and biotic interactions, and summarize these connections across an array of interacting species in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial systems. We end with suggestions for integrating the fields of landscape ecology and community ecology to better understand the connections between landscape structure and biotic interactions and better predict their dynamics in light of global change.","tags":null,"title":"The Interplay Between Landscape Structure and Biotic Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Belmaker","Phoebe Zarnetske","Mao-Ning Tuanmu","Sara Zonneveld","Sydne Record","Angela Strecker","Lydia Beaudrot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"1af5f7d88da02140ed10127ada716878","permalink":"/publication/belmaker-empirical-2015/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T12:44:50.334891Z","relpermalink":"/publication/belmaker-empirical-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim  Although it is recognized that ecological patterns are scale dependent, the exact scales over which specific ecological processes operate are still a matter of controversy. In particular, understanding the scales over which biotic interactions operate is critical for predicting changes in species distributions in the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. It has been hypothesized that biotic interactions operate predominately at fine grains, yet this conjecture has received relatively little empirical scrutiny. We use US woodpeckers as a model system to assess the relative importance of biotic interactions, environmental suitability and geographic proximity to other intraspecific occurrence sites, across scales.   Location  Conterminous United States.   Methods  We combined species occurrence data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) with a large pair-wise interaction matrix describing known interactions among woodpeckers and other bird species. Using a logistic mixed modelling framework we then established the relative importance of biotic interactions as predictors of woodpecker occurrences in relation to environment and geographic proximity to intraspecific occurrence sites.   Results  We found that geographic proximity becomes a stronger predictor of woodpecker occurrence as grain becomes coarser, while environment is grain-invariant. As opposed to environment and geographic proximity, we found that when the focal species experienced positive biotic interactions, the importance of interactions decreased with increased grain. However, positive interactions remained important up to a grain size of entire BBS routes (c. 40 km), which is much coarser than the grain size used by most species distribution models. In contrast, when the focal species experienced negative interactions we did not find clear grain dependence.   Main conclusions  Biotic interactions (both positive and negative) are important predictors of species occurrences. While these interactions are strongest at fine grains, they can remain important even at coarse grains, and are thus critical for predicting distributional changes in the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis.","tags":["scale","species distribution models","biotic interactions","Breeding Bird Survey","co-occurrence","extent","grain","Biotic interactions"],"title":"Empirical evidence for the scale dependence of biotic interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"NEON Organisms \u0026amp; Patterns of Biodiversity List of people mainly involved: Phoebe Zarnetske, Jon Knott, Ben Baiser, Kate Thibault, Sydne Record, Quentin Read\nGitHub repositories:\nhttps://github.com/NEON-biodiversity/neonbiodiversity\nhttps://github.com/NEON-biodiversity/rodentee\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"78374f19fd1cac90b1b321152f82e6f9","permalink":"/projects/neon-organisms-and-patterns-of-biodiversity/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/neon-organisms-and-patterns-of-biodiversity/","section":"projects","summary":"NEON Organisms \u0026amp; Patterns of Biodiversity List of people mainly involved: Phoebe Zarnetske, Jon Knott, Ben Baiser, Kate Thibault, Sydne Record, Quentin Read\nGitHub repositories:\nhttps://github.com/NEON-biodiversity/neonbiodiversity\nhttps://github.com/NEON-biodiversity/rodentee","tags":null,"title":"","type":"projects"}]
